# System Commands Sep 2023 OPPE 2

## Problem 1

In a markdown file, the level of heading is decided by the number of `#` at the beginning of the line. For example, `#` at the beginning of the line indicates a level 1 heading, `##` indicates a level 2 heading and so on. There is a space between `#` and heading text. The sample input shown below conveys the simplicity of the test cases.

Write a SED script 'script.sed'

- To reduce the level of heading by 1, for example `#` to `##` and `##` to `###`
- Add "# Text editors in Linux" as the first line

**Sample Input**

```text
# Line Editors
## Ed
---
# Modal Editors
## Vi
## Vim
## Neovim
---
# Non-modal Editors
## Nano
## Emacs
```

**Sample Output**

```text
# Text editors in Linux
## Line Editors
### Ed
---
## Modal Editors
### Vi
### Vim
### Neovim
---
## Non-modal Editors
### Nano
### Emacs
```

### Solution

```sed
/^#/ s/^/#/
1 i # Text editors in Linux
```

## Problem 2

A student named Pankaj found the output of the `diff` command confusing. He found two lines that looked the same but were marked as different. He presumed that it could be due to the presence of tab spaces present in the file. He wants to see the line end and tab characters. He decided to replace the tab spaces with "^I" and mark the end of the line with "$" in the files.

Write a **sed script** 'script.sed' to visualize the line end and tab characters by replacing them with `$` and `^I`, respectively.

**Example:**

```bash
$ cat file_a
abcd
efgh

$ cat file_b
efgh
ijkl

$ diff -u file_a file_b
--- file_a 2023-11-27 14:29:47.230882094 +0530

## Problem 3

Programmers are used to tag comments in the code with TODO, REVIEW, NOTE, HACK, FIXME, and DEPRECATED keywords.

Write an **AWK script** 'script.awk' to find all the occurrences in files and print only the filename and line number in the format `<filename>:<line number>`.

### Solution

```awk
/TODO|REVIEW|NOTE|HACK|FIXME|DEPRECATED/ {
    print FILENAME":"FNR
}
```

## Problem 4

Docker is a containerization platform that is used to run applications in an isolated environment. Each instance is called a container. We can run multiple containers in a single machine.

Here is a sample output from `docker ps -a` command, which lists all the containers in the machine.

**Sample Input**

```text
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                          COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS                     PORTS                                       NAMES
fa9130a84431   mongo-express                  "/sbin/tini -- /dock…"   5 days ago    Exited (143) 6 hours ago                                               stock-analyser-mongo-express-1
830b9ccaa6c8   mongo                          "docker-entrypoint.s…"   5 days ago    Exited (0) 6 hours ago                                                 stock-analyser-mongo-1

```

Write a **bash script** 'script.sh' to extract the container id, image name, status and name from the output similar to the above and print it in a CSV format such that

- If the string in the STATUS column has the "Up" word in it, then the whole string in the column is replaced with "RUNNING" otherwise "STOPPED".

Note:

- The output from `docker ps -a` will be given as standard input

**Sample Output**

```text
CONTAINER ID,IMAGE,STATUS,NAMES
fa9130a84431,mongo-express,STOPPED,stock-analyser-mongo-express-1
830b9ccaa6c8,mongo,STOPPED,stock-analyser-mongo-1
db00571f20eb,redis,RUNNING,jovial_pasteur
```

### Prefix

```bash

### Solution

```bash
sed 's/    */   /g' |
awk '
    BEGIN {
        FS="[   ]{3}[ ]*"; OFS=","
    }
    NR == 1 {
        print "CONTAINER ID", "IMAGE", "STATUS", "NAMES"
    }
    $5 ~ "Up" {
        print $1, $2, "RUNNING", $NF
    }
    $5 ~ "Exited" {
        print $1, $2, "STOPPED", $NF
    }
'

# Alternate solution
awk '
    BEGIN {
        OFS=","
    }
    NR == 1 {
        print "CONTAINER ID", "IMAGE", "STATUS", "NAMES"
    }
    $0 ~ "Up" {
        print $1, $2, "RUNNING", $NF
    }
    $0 ~ "Exited" {
        print $1, $2, "STOPPED", $NF
    }

## Problem 5

There are two files `file_a` and `file_b` which contain a list of hash values.
Write a **bash script** 'script.sh' to find the hash values with the order of their occurrence that are present in either of the files but not in both (eXclusive OR).

**Sample Input**

```bash
$ cat file_a
e5fa44f2
7448d879
a3db5c13
9c6b057a
$ cat file_b
a3db5c13
9c6b057a
5d9474c0
ccf271b7
```

**Sample Output**

```bash
e5fa44f2
7448d879
5d9474c0
ccf271b7
```

### Prefix

```bash
script() {
cat > script.awk << EOF
```

### Solution

```awk
NR == FNR {
    a[$0] = 1
    next
}
{
    if ($0 in a) {
        delete a[$0]
    } else {
        a[$0] = 1
    }
}
END {
    for (i in a) {
        print i
    }
}

: '
# Another Solution
{flag = 1}
NR == FNR && !a[$0] {a[$0] = 1}
NR != FNR && !a[$0] {a[$0] = 1; flag = 0}
NR != FNR && a[$0] && flag {a[$0] = 0}
END {for (i in a) if (a[i] == 1) print i}
'
```

### Suffix

```bash
EOF
awk -f script.awk file_a file_b
}
```

### Invisible Code

```bash
while read -r line; do
    [[ "$line" == EOF ]] && cat > file_2 && break
    echo "$line"
done > file_1 < file_a
\cat file_2 file_1

script 2>&1

## Problem 6

Write a script `script.sh` to analyze the logs given in the file auth.log provided as standard input to print all the usernames to which user student switched to using `su` command.

Note:

- switching back to the previous user should not be accounted.
- A sample `auth.log` file is provided `/opt/se2001/oppe2.1_section_2_problem_2/auth.log`

The sample contents of auth.log (stdin) are given below.
