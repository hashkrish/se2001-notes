## Question 6 [7]

Select the output from the below script. [MCQ]

```bash
var="Water"
echo "-var-"
echo "-${var2:=Air}-"
echo "-${var2:-Fire}-"
echo "-${var2:+Earth}-"
```

(a)

```text
-Water-
-Air-
-Fire-
-Earth-
```

(b)

```text
-var-
-Air-
-Fire-
-Earth-
```

(c)

```text
-var-
-Air-
-Air-
-Earth-
```

(d)

```text
--
-Air-
-Air-
-Air-
```

### Answer

(c)

### Explanation

- `var` is not used in the script, so its initialized value does not affect the output.
- `var2:=Air` will set the value of the variable `var2` to be `Air` if it is unset. It then returns the value of `var2`.
- `var2:-Fire` will return `Air` if `var2` is unset, else return the value of `var2`.
- `var2:+Earth` will return `Earth` if `var2` is set, else return the value of `var2` (empty string).
- `var2` is not set initially, so the first command sets it to `Air` and prints it.
- `var2` is set now, so it simply returns its value `Air` again and prints it.
- `var2` is set, so it returns `Earth` and prints it. (But the value of `var2` remains as Air)

## Question 7 [7]

In an organization a particular software requires a key file. The key file will change at 6 am and 6 pm. The command `generate-key` will generate the key file with either of the option `--day` or `--night` with respect to the time at which the command is executed.
Choose the command that does the above job. [MCQ]

Hint:
The output of date command with and without the option are shown below.

```bash
$ date +%H:%M
15:06

$ date
Monday 19 September 2022 03:06:44 PM IST
```

(a)

```bash
[[ $(date +%H:%M) > 06:00 && $(date +%H:%M) < 18:00 ]] &&
  generate-key --day ||
  generate-key --night
```

(b)

```bash
[[ $(date) > 06:00 || $(date) < 18:00 ]] &&
  generate-key --day ||
  generate-key --night
```

(c)

```bash
[[ $(date +%H:%M) > 06:00 && $(date +%H:%M) < 18:00 ]] &&
  generate-key --night ||
  generate-key --day
```

(d)

```bash
[[ $(date +%H:%M) -gt 06:00 && $(date +%H:%M) -lt 18:00 ]] &&
  generate-key --day ||
  generate-key --night
```

### Answer

(a)

### Explanation

- `date +%H:%M` will give the current time in 24-hour format.
- You can compare dates by directly doing string comparison if it is in 24-hour format in MSB to LSB order.
- The command `generate-key --day` will be executed if the current time is greater than 6:00 and less than 18:00, else `generate-key --night` will be executed.
- `-gt` and `-lt` are used for integer comparison, so it will not work for string comparison.

```text
$ pwd
/home/ram/tmp/6177

$ ls -li
total 0
28320712 -rw-rw-r-- 1 ram ram 0 Sep 20 13:24 notes.md
28320714 -rw-rw-r-- 1 ram ram 0 Sep 20 13:24 quicklinks.md
28320713 -rw-rw-r-- 4 ram ram 0 Sep 20 13:24 todo.md
```

(a) 1, 4

(b) 4,1

(c) 1,0

(d) 4,cannot be determined with above data

(e) cannot be determined with above data, cannot be determined with above data

### Answer

(d)

### Explanation

- The third field in the output of `ls -li` command is the number of hardlinks. It shows that `todo.md` has 4 hardlinks.
- The number of softlinks cannot be determined from the output of `ls -li` command as there can be softlinks to `todo.md` present in other directories as well.

---

**Consider the below command outputs for question 10 and 11**

Note that in the output of the command `ls -li` the first field is the inode number. Also that /home/ram is the home directory of the user.

```shell
$ pwd
/home/ram/tmp/6177

$ ls -li
total 0
28320712 -rw-rw-r-- 1 ram ram 0 Sep 20 13:24 notes.md
28320714 -rw-rw-r-- 1 ram ram 0 Sep 20 13:24 quicklinks.md
28320713 -rw-rw-r-- 4 ram ram 0 Sep 20 13:24 todo.md
```

```shell
$ cd /home/ram/tmp/28041

$ pwd
/home/ram/tmp/28041

$ ls -li
total 0
28320713 -rw-rw-r-- 4 ram ram  0 Sep 20 13:24 todo2.md
28320713 -rw-rw-r-- 4 ram ram  0 Sep 20 13:24 todo3.md
28320716 -rw-rw-r-- 1 ram ram  0 Sep 20 13:26 todo4.md
28320717 lrwxrwxrwx 1 ram ram 15 Sep 20 13:26 todo5.md -> ../6177/todo.md
28320718 lrwxrwxrwx 1 ram ram 16 Sep 20 13:26 todo6.md -> ../6177/notes.md
28320713 -rw-rw-r-- 4 ram ram  0 Sep 20 13:24 todo.md
```

## Question 10 [5]

With respect to the above given data, how many files in `~/tmp/28041` is referring (hardlink + softlink) to the file `~/tmp/6177/todo.md` ? [NAT]

### Answer

4

### Explanation

- `todo2.md`, `todo3.md`, and `todo.md` in `~/tmp/28041` are hardlinks to `todo.md` in `~/tmp/6177` as they have the same inode number.
- `todo5.md` in `~/tmp/28041` is a softlink to `todo.md` in `~/tmp/6177`.
- So, there are 4 files in `~/tmp/28041` referring to `todo.md` in `~/tmp/6177`.

## Question 11 [6]

With respect to the above given data, if the directory name `~/tmp/6177` is changed to `~/tmp/6178`, then which of the files in `~/tmp/28041` will be broken? [MSQ]

(a) todo.md

(b) todo2.md

(c) todo3.md

(d) todo4.md

(e) todo5.md

(f) todo6.md

### Answer

(e), (f)

### Explanation

- `todo5.md` is a softlink to `todo.md` in `~/tmp/6177`. If the directory name is changed to `~/tmp/6178`, then the softlink will be broken.
- `todo6.md` is a softlink to `notes.md` in `~/tmp/6177`. If the directory name is changed to `~/tmp/6178`, then the softlink will be broken.

## Question 13 [6]

Choose the command that matches a sequence of one or more digits at the end of the lines in the file `data.txt`. [MCQ]

(a) `grep '^[0-9]*' data.txt`

(b) `grep '[0-9][0-9]*' data.txt`

(c) `grep '[0-9]*[0-9]$' data.txt`

(d) `grep '^[0-9]*[0-9]$' data.txt`

### Answer

(c)

### Explanation

- `^` matches the start of the line.
- `[0-9]*` matches zero or more digits.
- `[0-9]` matches exactly one digit.
- `$` matches the end of the line.
- `[0-9]*[0-9]` matches one or more digits.
- So, the command `grep '[0-9]*[0-9]$' data.txt` matches a sequence of one or more digits at the end of the lines in the file `data.txt`.

## Question 14 [6]

The contents of file.txt is given below

```text
You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,
Love like you'll never be hurt,
Sing like there's nobody listening,
And live like it's heaven on earth.
― William W. Purkey
```

Select the command that prints the output same as the contents of file.txt [MSQ]

(a) `grep . file.txt`

(b) `grep .* file.txt`

(c) `grep [0-9] file.txt`

(d) `grep [.] file.txt`

### Answer

(a), (b)

### Explanation

- `grep .` will print all the non-empty lines in the file. In this file we don't have any empty lines, so it is equivalent to `cat file.txt`.
- `grep .*` will print all the lines in the file. It is equivalent to `cat file.txt`.
- `grep [0-9]` will print all the lines that contain a digit in the file. But there are no digits in the file, so it will not print anything.
- `grep [.]` will print all the lines that contain a dot in the file. So it will print the last two lines.

(a) `8iadaz`

(b) `3g2z`

(c) `jkjkjkjk2j2yjkjk`

(d) `.a.a.a.2.2.1.`

(e) `00210132a1z01231`

(f) `1a2w01231`

### Answer

(b), (e)

### Explanation

- The pattern `[0-3][a-g][123][xyz]` matches the following:
  - `[0-3]` → Any digit from 0 to 3
  - `[a-g]` → Any lowercase alphabet from a to g
  - `[123]` → Any digit from 1 to 3
  - `[xyz]` → Any character x, y, or z
- The input `3g2z` matches the pattern.
- The input `00210132a1z01231` matches the pattern (`2a1z`).
