# System Commands, End Term Set-1

## Question 1 (echo) [6]

```shell
$ help echo
echo: echo [-neE] [arg ...]
    Write arguments to the standard output.

    Display the ARGs, separated by a single space character and followed
    by a newline, on the standard output.

    Options:
      -n    do not append a newline
      -e    enable interpretation of the following backslash escapes
      -E    explicitly suppress interpretation of backslash escapes

    `echo` interprets the following backslash-escaped characters:
      ......
      \n    new line
      ......
```

What will be the output of the below script?

```bash
echo -n '* ' # There is a space after *
echo -ne '*\n*\n* '  # There is a space after the last *
echo -n '* ' # There is a space after *
```

(a)

```text
*
* * *
*
```

(b)

```text
* * * * *
```

(c)

```text
* *\n*\n* *
```

(d)

```text
* *
*
* *
```

### Answer

(d)

### Explanation

- `-n` in `echo` means a newline at the end won't be printed automatically.
- `-e` in `echo` means the backslash escapes will be interpreted.
- `\n` in the string will be interpreted as a newline character.

## Question 2 (link) [6]

A college student uses a pen drive to store files. The pen drive is always mounted on his system at `/mount` as a separate file system. His pen drive contains lots of files and directories. He wants to create a link to the directory `/mount/bio/phase-2/project-312` inside his home directory. What link can the student use?

(a) soft link

(b) hard link

(c) either soft link or hard link

(d) links will not work for this requirement

### Answer

(a)

### Explanation

- A soft link is a pointer to the file or directory. It is a symbolic link to the file or directory.
- A hard link is a pointer to the inode of the file. It is a direct link to the file.
- Hard link cannot be created for directories.
- Hard links cannot be created across file systems.
- Soft link will work for this requirement as it uses the path to the file or directory.

## Question 3 (shell variable) [7]

Complete the script to rename all the files in the current directory to include the time of creation in the name itself as given in the example below. Assume all the files have creation times.

Example: The filename `myfile` should be renamed to `myfile_2022-10-20T14:52:58`

```bash
for file in *; do
    creation_time=$(stat -c '%w' $file)
    # Sample output from `stat -c %w FILE`
    # "2022-10-20 14:52:58.738413991 +0530"
    # ***********************
    # * COMPLETE THE SCRIPT *
    # ***********************
done
```

(a)

```bash
mv $file ${creation_time/ /T}
```

(b)

```bash
mv $file $creation_time
```

(c)

```bash
temp="${creation_time%%.*}"
temp="${temp/ /T}"
mv "$file" "${file}_$temp"
```

(d)

```bash
temp="${creation_time%%.*}"
temp="${temp/ /T}"
mv "$file" "$temp"
```

### Answer

(c)

### Explanation

- `${creation_time%%.*}` removes the fractional part of the time.
- `${temp/ /T}` replaces the space with `T` to make the time format ISO 8601 compliant.
- `${file}_$temp` renames the file with the time of creation.

## Question 5 [vi/emacs](6)

What does the key sequence `G$vgg0yGp` do in vi editor?
Hint:

- `v` to enter into visual mode
- `p` to paste next
- `y` to copy selected

or

What does the key sequence `<M->><C-SPACE><M-<><C-w><C-y>` do in Emacs?
Hint:

- `<C-SPACE>` to set a mark
- `<C-W>` copy text from mark to current cursor position
- `<C-y>` to paste text

(a) Cut the paragraph and paste at the end of the document.

(b) Copy the paragraph and paste at the end of the document.

(c) Cut and paste the entire document (finally one copy of initial document)

(d) Copy and paste the entire document (finally two copies of initial document)

### Answer

(d)

### Explanation

- `G` moves the cursor to the last line.
- `$` moves the cursor to the end of the line.
- `v` enters visual mode.
- `gg` moves the cursor to the first line.
- `0` moves the cursor to the beginning of the line. Entire document is selected.
- `y` copies the selected text (entire document).
- `G` moves the cursor to the last line (first character).
- `p` pastes the copied text (entire document).
- The pasted document is pasted after the first character of last line, not at the end of the document.

## Question 6 (shell script) [MSQ] [8]

A student named Varsha has a lot of configuration files in her Linux system. Somehow she lost all the data,
but fortunately she backed up her configuration files in a specific way such that the backup directory named `backup_config` contains all the configuration files along with one file named `files`.
The file `files` contains the absolute paths to the config files, one path per line for each config file.
Choose the script that restores all the files to their location.
Assume the backup directory contains only files not directories.
The current working directory where the scripts are run is `backup_config` directory.

(a)

```bash
for file in `cat files`; do
    cp "${file/*/}" "${file%:}"
done
```

(b)

```bash
while read file; do
    cp "./${file##*/}" "$file"
done < files
```

(c)

```bash
while read file; do
    cp "./${file//*\//}" "$file"
done < files
```

(d)

```bash
for file in `cat files`; do
    cp "$file" "./${file##*/}"
done
```

### Answer

(b), (c)

### Explanation

- `${file/*/}` removes everything from the variable `file`, this is not the correct way to get the file name from the path.
- `./${file##*/}` gets the file name from the path by removing everything from the start till the last `/`.
- `cp "./${file##*/}" "$file"` copies the file in the current directory with the file name to its original location.
- `${file//*\//}` removes everything from the variable `file` till the last `/`.
- `cp "./${file//*\//}" "$file"` copies the file in the current directory with the file name to its original location.

## Question 7 (shell script) [NAT] [6]

How many lines will be printed after executing the below script?

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
    f=0
    if ((i%3==0)); then
        f=1
        continue
    fi
    if [[ $f -eq 1 &&  $i -gt 5 ]]; then
        continue
    fi
    echo '***'
done
```

### Answer (exact)

7

### Explanation

- We set the value of `f=0` in every iteration.
- The only time `f=1` is done, is directly followed by a `continue` statement, which resets it back to `0`.
- Thus, the second `if` condition will never be true and can be removed.
- We only skip over the iteration when `i` is a multiple of 3.
- Out of the 10 iterations, 3, 6, and 9 are multiples of 3, so they are skipped.
- Rest 7 numbers will print `***`.

## Question 8 [shell script](6)

Select the correct statement(s) based on the below script. Assume that `file1` is not empty.
Hint: `tee` command takes the stdin and prints it to the terminal and also writes to the file given as argument.

```bash
while read line; do
    echo $line
done < file1 > file2 | tee file3
```

(a) _file2_ will be empty at the end of execution

(b) _file3_ will be empty at the end of execution

(c) The contents of _file1_ will be displayed in the terminal

(d) _file3_ will contains the contents of _file1_

### Answer

(b)

### Explanation

- The `while` loop reads the contents of `file1` and prints it to the stdout.
- That is redirected to the file `file2`.
- The `tee` command gets nothing in stdin, thus prints nothing to terminal, and writes nothing to `file3`.

## Question 9 (grep/regex) [6]

Choose the regular expression to match with a string that contains at least a character repeated three times anywhere in the same line. Assume that the regular expression is using Extended Regular Expression Engine (ERE).

(a) `...`

(b) `.*.*.*`

(c) `(.)\1\1`

(d) `(.).*\1.*\1`

(e) `^(.).*\1.*\1$`

### Answer

(d)

### Explanation

- `.` matches any character.
- `.*` matches zero or more occurrences of any character.
- `(.).*\1.*\1` matches any character followed by zero or more occurrences of any character followed by the same character followed by zero or more occurrences of any character followed by the same character.
- `(.)\1\1` matches any character present thrice _consecutively_ in the line, this is not asked.
- (e) requires the character to be at the starting and end of the line, this is not asked.

---

## Question 10 (grep/regex) [8]

Choose the matching line(s) for any of the following regular expressions. Assume the regular expression is using Extended Regular Expression Engine (ERE). [MSQ]

```text
^$
^([[:digit:]]){3,}$
^[^.]+$
```

(a) An empty line

(b) A line having a number with only one decimal place (Ex: 10.1)

(c) A line without a space

(d) A line with three spaces

(e) A line starts with two repeated numbers

(f) A line containing four repeated numbers

(g) A line without a dot

(h) A line with one or more dot characters

### Answer

(a), (f), (g)

## Question 11 (sed) [6]

What does the given sed script do?

_Hint_: `N` command in sed appends the next line to the pattern space(current line) with a newline character `\n` being the separator.

```sed
N
N
s/\n//g
```

(a) Merge every two consecutive lines to a single line

(b) Merge every three consecutive lines to a single line

(c) Merge every four consecutive lines to a single line

(d) The input remains unaltered

### Answer

(b)

---

## Question 12 [sed](6) [NAT]

The input file to the below sed script named `data` contains 100 characters, among them 47 are numbers `[0-9]`. How many characters will be in the output after executing the below script? Assume that sed is using Extended Regular Expression Engine (ERE). [MSQ]

```sed
s/([0-9])/\1\1/g
s/([0-9])\1/\1/g
```

### Answer

100

### Explanation

- The first `s` command replaces every number with two occurrences of the same number.
- The second `s` command replaces every number with two occurrences of the same number with a single occurrence of the number.
- The sed script is an identity transformation, it does not change the input.

---

## Question 13 (sed) [8]

Consider a file named `data` containing some text located in the current working directory. Select the correct statement(s) for the output printed by the below script.

```bash
count=0
while read line; do
    # -o in grep will print only the matches not the entire line,
    # and prints one match per line
    for i in `echo "$line" | grep -o '~ITER~'`; do
        ((count++))
        line="${line/~ITER~/$count}" # ~ITER~ is replaced with $count
    done
    echo "$line"
done < data
```

(a) Only the first occurrence of `~ITER~` in every line of the file `data` is replaced

(b) The value replaced with `~ITER~` is constant across the lines

(c) The value of `count` at the end of execution and total number of occurrences of `~ITER~` in the file `data` are equal

(d) The same result can be achieved within file `data` with the following script

```bash
# -q in grep gives only the exit status, not output
c=0; while $(grep -q "~ITER~"); do
    ((c++)); sed "s/~ITER~/$c/"
done
```

### Answer

(c)

### Explanation

- The script reads the file line by line.
- For every occurrence of `~ITER~` in the line, it replaces it with the value of `count`.
- The value of `count` is incremented for every occurrence of `~ITER~`.
- The value of `count` at the end of execution and total number of occurrences of `~ITER~` in the file `data` are equal.
- The later occurrences in a line are also replaced as the for loop iterates over all the occurrences of `~ITER~` in the line.

## Question 14 (awk) [6]

What will the output from the below command represent?

```bash
awk '
{
    arr[$0]++
}
arr[$0] == 2 {
    print
}
' data
```

(a) The lines that are distinct

(b) The lines that are repeated exactly twice

(c) The lines that are repeated twice or more

(d) The lines that are repeated more than twice

### Answer

(c)

### Explanation

- The script reads the file line by line.
- It maintains a count of each line in the array `arr`.
- If the count of the line is 2, it prints the line.
- Lines present more than twice will also have its count as 2 at some point when the line is read for the second time.
- The lines that are repeated twice or more are printed.

---

## Question 15 [awk](8) [NAT]

What will be the output from the below script?

```bash
awk '
{
    x[NR]=$1; y[NR]=$2
    x_+=$1;   y_+=$2
}
END {
    x_=x_/NR; y_=y_/NR
    denx_2=0; deny_2=0
    for (i in x) {
        num+=(x[i]-x_)*(y[i]-y_)
        denx_2+=(x[i]-x_)^2
        deny_2+=(y[i]-y_)^2
    }
    print num/(denx_2^0.5 * deny_2^0.5)
}
' << EOF
1 2
3 4
5 6
7 8
EOF
```

### Answer

1

### Explanation

- The script is finding the Pearson correlation coefficient between two variables.
- The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables.
- The given data is clearly linearly related($y=x+1$), so the Pearson correlation coefficient will be 1.
