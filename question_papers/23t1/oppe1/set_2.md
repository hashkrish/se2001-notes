## Section-1 Problem 1

Write a script to create a link named `storage` in the current directory to the file, its path is stored in the variable `FILE_PATH` such that the content in the link persists even the source file is deleted.

### Prefix

```bash
script() {
```

### Suffix

```bash
}
```

### Invisible code

```bash
dir=$RANDOM
while [ -d "$dir" ]; do
  dir=$RANDOM
done
mkdir "$dir" &> /dev/null
cd "$dir"

read file
read line
read FILE_PATH

touch $FILE_PATH

script 2>&1

[[ -h storage ]] && echo ./storage is not an expected link type.

echo $line > "$DIR_PATH/$file"
cat "storage/$file"

```

### Solution

```bash
ln "$FILE_PATH" storage
```

## Section-1 Problem 2

In a school consists of first to twelfth standard, each standard has 5 sections named from `A` to `E`. So, the classroom number is given as standard (in number) followed by section, for an example `12E`, `3C`, etc... Each classroom has 40 students. There is a directory for every classroom. All the directories can be located inside the current directory. There is a file for every student named from 1 to 40 in every directory.

Suddenly, the school experienced a 40% drop in first and sixth standard, so they reduced the number of students in each classroom to 32.

Your task is to remove the extra files in the respective directories.

### Prefix

```bash
script() {
```

### Suffix

```bash
}
```

### Invisible code

```bash
dir=$RANDOM
while [ -d "$dir" ]; do
  dir=$RANDOM
done
mkdir "$dir" &> /dev/null
cd "$dir"

mkdir {1..12}{A..E}
touch {1..12}{A..E}/{1..40}

script 2>&1

find | sort

```

### Solution

```bash
rm {1,6}{A..E}/{33..40}
```

## Section-1 Problem 3

A company collected some data from the user and stored it in a CSV file `data.txt` in the current working directory. It contains the fields name, date of birth (YYYY-MM-DD) and location respectively.

Write a script to find all person whose month and date have the same numerical value.

- Print the entire line if the above condition matches
- Example: `Aksel Cockell,1972-03-03,Skaryszew`
  - Here the month `03` and date `03` are the same.

### Prefix

```bash
script() {
```

### Suffix

```bash
}
```

### Invisible code

```bash
dir=$RANDOM
while [ -d "$dir" ]; do
  dir=$RANDOM
done
mkdir "$dir" &> /dev/null
cd "$dir"


cat > data.csv

script 2>&1
```

### Solution

```bash
egrep "^[^,]+,[0-9]{4}-(..)-\1,[^,]+" data.csv
```

## Section-2 Problem 4

Write a script to find the largest file (not directory) by size in the current directory and its subdirectories (recursion happens unless there are no directories left).

Hint:

- Use `find` command to print the all files and directories in the current directory.

```bash
$ sort --help
Usage: sort [OPTION]... [FILE]...
  or:  sort [OPTION]... --files0-from=F
Write sorted concatenation of all FILE(s) to standard output.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
Ordering options:

    .......
  -n, --numeric-sort          compare according to string numerical value
    .......
  -r, --reverse               reverse the result of comparisons
    .......
  -C, --check=quiet, --check=silent  like -c, but do not report first bad line
      --compress-program=PROG  compress temporaries with PROG;
                              decompress them with PROG -d
      --debug               annotate the part of the line used to sort,
                              and warn about questionable usage to stderr
      --files0-from=F       read input from the files specified by
                            NUL-terminated names in file F;
                            If F is - then read names from standard input
  -k, --key=KEYDEF          sort via a key; KEYDEF gives location and type
    .......
  -t, --field-separator=SEP  use SEP instead of non-blank to blank transition
    .......
```

### Prefix

```bash
script() {
```

### Suffix

```bash
}
```

### Invisible code

```bash
DIR=$RANDOM
while [[ -a $DIR ]]; do DIR=$RANDOM; done
mkdir $DIR; cd $DIR

cat | bash

script 2>&1
```

### Solution

```bash
find . -type f |
    while read line; do
    line="$(ls -l $line)"
    echo ${line//  / }
    done |
    sort -t " " -k 5 -rn |
    head -1 |
    cut -d " " -f 9

# Alternate solution
find -exec ls -l {} \; | awk '$5 > mx { mx=$5; mv=$9 } END { print mv }'
```

### Test cases

#### Public

##### Input 1

```bash
touch a b c
echo 1234 > b
```

##### Output 1

```text
./b
```

##### Input 2

```bash
touch {1..100}
echo 123456789 > 9
echo 12345678 > 8

echo 123456 > 6
echo 12345 > 5

```

##### Output 2

```text
./9
```

##### Input 3

```bash
mkdir {a..c}
touch {a..c}/0
echo 1234 > b/0
```

##### Output 3

mkdir {a..c}
touch {a..c}/0
echo 1234 > b/0
echo 12345678 >> a/0
echo 12345678 >> a/0
```

##### Output 3

echo 1 > a/b/d/c/0
echo 2 > a/b/b/c/0
```

##### Output 4
