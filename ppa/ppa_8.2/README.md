# Programming Practice Assignment - Week 8 - Question 2

## Problem Statement

Without using the `wc` or `awk` commands (instead use sed as Bash command),
write a **bash** script that accepts any number of arguments.
Out of these some would be options (hyphen plus a character like -l or -c)
and the last argument will be a **file path**
(use ${@: -1} to access the last argument, there is a space before -1).
Only four options are accepted by your script `-l`, `-w`, `-n` and `-s`.

Assume that file path given will always be for a valid file and we will refer it as file in the next lines.

For options,

- If no option is supplied to your script do nothing.
- If `-l` option is supplied, print the number of lines in the file.
- If `-w` option is supplied, print the number of words in the file.
  Assume that any string between spaces is a word.
  i.e. if using awk count the number of fields in each line to get the word count.
- If `-n` option is supplied, print the number of lines having only digits(no alphabets or spaces) in the file.
- option `-s` also accepts an argument say str.
  In this case print the number of lines containing the string str.
- The above options can be supplied together or more than once.
  Print the required count for each appearance of the option on a new line. For e.g.
  - if `-l` and `-w` are both supplied together in the sequence print count of lines and count of words each on separate lines.
  - If `-l`, `-n` and `-l` options are supplied in the sequence then print number of lines, number of lines containing only digits and finally again number of lines in the file each on separate line.

Note: Your bash script should not even contain any variable or comment that contains the string `wc` or `awk`.

**Hints**:

- Use `while getopts` style code.
- Use `sed` to find the count of lines as specified in the conditions above.

## Sample Input

Suppose your bash script is named as `myCount.sh`.
In the below sample the argument to `-s` option is "say" so this should count all the lines containing the string "say".
For the public test case all the commands given in the below sample are executed one by one on the input file.

```bash
$ cat somefile.txt
This is a sample file
this is not end justsay start
that contains say
some number
say like 10
or
20
or
233
444
or say 3444
and now it ends.
```

## Sample Output

```bash
$ bash myCount.sh -l somefile.txt
12
$ bash myCount.sh -w somefile.txt
32
$ bash myCount.sh -n somefile.txt
3
$ bash myCount.sh -s say somefile.txt
4
$ bash myCount.sh -l -n somefile.txt
12
3
$ bash myCount.sh -l -s say -l -n somefile.txt
12
4
12
3
$ bash myCount.sh
$ bash myCount.sh somefile.txt
```

## Instructions

Write your solution in the file `myCount.sh`.
Your script will not receive any input from the standard input.
Your script should output to the standard output.
