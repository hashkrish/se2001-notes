# Programming Practice Assignment - Week 5 - Question 7

## Problem Statement

Mine the logs given in the file `myauth.log` present in the current working directory to print all the usernames to which user `student` switched to using `su` command.

Note: switching back to the previous user should not be accounted.

Hint: Basically you have to grep all the lines where `su` command is run successfully and fetch the **username** to which the user `student` switched to.

Contents of `myauth.log` is given below.

## Sample Input
