# Programming Practice Assignment - Week 1 - Question 1

## Problem Statement

Write a bash command to move all the `.txt` files present in the current directory to the directory named `level1` present inside the current directory.

## Instructions

Do not move any other files other than `.txt` files anywhere from the current directory.

Write only a single line bash command to perform the above task.

The script should not produce any output.

The script will not receive any input from arguments or standard input.

The command should be saved in the file `movetext.sh`

## Sample Input

Assume the following output of `tree` command in the current directory.

```text
./
├── abc.txt
├── level1/
├── test.c
├── test.cpp
├── test.java
├── test.py
└── test.txt
```

## Sample Output

After running your `movetext.sh`, the output of `tree` should be as follows.

```text
./
├── level1/
│   ├── abc.txt
│   └── test.txt
├── test.c
├── test.cpp
├── test.java
└── test.py
```
